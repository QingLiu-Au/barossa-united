      <p><strong>Sports Voucher</strong></p>
      <p>
        The Sports Vouchers program is a Government of South Australia
        initiative administered by the Office for Recreation, Sport and Racing.
        As part of the State Budget for 2021-22, the Government announced the
        expansion of Sports Vouches to students in Years 8 and 9. This will
        commence from 1 January 2022.The program provides an opportunity to
        receive up to a $100 discount on sports or dance membership/registration
        fees. The purpose is to increase the number of children playing
        organised sport or participating in dance activities by reducing cost as
        a barrier. Once the 2022 sports voucher has been released we will send
        this to all families to be used against your fees for the 2022 season.
      </p>
      <p>
        If using a Sports Voucher the Barossa United Junior Soccer Club require
        fees to be paid upfront in full, then Club will then facilitate the
        Sports Voucher refund on your behalf. You can read more about the Sports
